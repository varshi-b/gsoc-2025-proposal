## Project Abstract
I propose to improve JupyterLab's documentation infrastructure by:
1. Implementing automated quality checks for docs builds
2. Adding dark mode support to documentation
3. Creating contributor-friendly templates for docs maintenance
This will enhance both user experience and contributor onboarding.

## Technical Approach
- **Phase 1 (Community Bonding)**:
  - Audit current documentation pipeline
  - Design dark mode CSS framework
  - Set up Sphinx test suite

- **Phase 2 (Implementation)**:
  - Integrate doctest verification
  - Implement responsive dark/light mode toggle
  - Create PR templates for docs contributions

- **Phase 3 (Polish)**:
  - Write contributor guides
  - Add CI checks for doc builds
  - Conduct user testing

## Open Source Contributions
- **[JupyterLab PR #1](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1)**:
  - Standardized Makefile indentation (project convention)
  - Added test target for documentation verification
  - Improved maintainability of build system

## Why Me?
- **Skills**: Python, Sphinx, CI/CD, technical writing
- **Experience**: Demonstrated understanding of JupyterLab's docs infrastructure
- **Passion**: Committed to making open-source more accessible through better docs
